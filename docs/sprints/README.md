# Sprint Planning for Kaneo

This folder contains the planning documents for adding Jira-style sprint planning to Kaneo.

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Feature list](./feature-list.md) | The required features grouped by area, each with a Jira reference and a MoSCoW priority. |
| [Gap analysis](./gap-analysis.md) | The contrast between Kaneo's capability before the feature and the target, with reusable foundations and assumptions. |
| [Requirements and implementation plan](./requirements-implementation-plan.md) | Functional requirements, business rules, data model, API design, UI specification, and the phased implementation plan. |

## Scope summary

- Every task carries a sprint assignment; tasks of type Bug default to the active sprint, all other types default to the backlog.
- A task's sprint can be changed only among the active sprint, future sprints, and the backlog; closed sprints are immutable.
- Closing a sprint moves unfinished tasks to a selected target sprint or the backlog, while completed tasks remain in the closed sprint as the history of implementation.
- Project settings define the default sprint length in days.
- Sprints can be created, renamed, edited while future, and reordered, following Jira's sprint management as the behavioural reference.
- The sprint planning panel lists the tasks of every sprint section, and sprint-scheduled tasks leave the plain backlog list below.
- The board offers a sprint filter, and the backlog bulk toolbar moves the selected tasks between sprints and the backlog.

The gap analysis was written from public sources before implementation; the assumptions listed there were verified against this repository when the feature was implemented on the `feat/sprint-planning` branch.
